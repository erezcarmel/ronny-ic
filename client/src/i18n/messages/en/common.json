        "title": "I treat anxiety and mood problems, emotional regulation, learning and attention, behavior, social integration, eating disorders, questions of self-image, identity formation and interpersonal relationships, life crises, and parent-child relationships. My approach is present and involved, focused on creating contact, connecting to the strengths and parts that function well in each person, and gradually touching the more painful or turbulent places. After the initial introductory phase, it is important for me to set clear goals for treatment with you, and work towards achieving them. I also incorporate cognitive and behavioral tools (from CBT, IPT or ACT) as needed, as part of a broad and dynamic view of who you are. As an educational psychologist, I understand well the important impact of kindergarten and school, including the social and educational situation and the child's relationship with educational figures, on his mental health. Therefore, as needed, I am in contact with elements in the system or attend school meetings, and participate in the development of comprehensive intervention programs.",
        "content1-title": "Treatment of young adults",
        "content1-text": "I am here for you, to unpack, to put your thoughts, feelings and aspirations for the future in order, to understand what is not working for you and what you would like to change, and to strengthen what is already working well. You can engage in work, studies, relationships, friends, family, difficult events, daily annoyances... Together we can define who you want to be and how you want to live to get there, practice how to treat yourself more beautifully, with compassion and understanding, and invest in yourself (self-care), how to communicate more effectively with others, and/or try additional ways of coping in a variety of situations.",
        "content2-title": "Adolescent care",
        "content2-text": "Let's meet. It can be through talking, through silence, sometimes even through play. I'm there with you, so that you won't be alone with all the tension, emotional flooding, loneliness, doubts and questions. True, sometimes it's completely enough to talk to a good friend or your mother, or simply manage on your own. But there are times when you need contact with someone from the outside, who brings both professional knowledge and experience as well as caring, understanding and a willingness to listen. Someone who won't immediately panic, get angry, or scold. So that you can share even the difficult or painful things, discover what you need to do something different this time, and to feel better about yourself and those around you. Yes, sometimes I dig a little, but when asked, I stop. No, I don't give the contents of the meeting to the parents, but I summarize the rules of privacy and confidentiality together in advance.",
        "content3-title": "Play therapy for children",
        "content3-text": "Play therapy for children is based on games and games in psychology and educational psychology. Games provide a way to relate to objects and situations effectively and quickly, and allow children to relate to objects and situations effectively and quickly. Games provide a way to relate to objects and situations effectively and quickly, and allow children to relate to objects and situations effectively and quickly.",
        "content4-title": "Parent training and therapeutic work with parents",
        "content4-text": "If you are concerned about your children's functioning, or your relationship with them, come for consultation, to seek support, and to think together. Perhaps even to go through a process that will change you as parents and as people. My approach combines a practical approach to dealing with your children's unwanted behaviors, along with a desire for a deeper understanding of their inner motivations and needs, an understanding of each parent's relationship with each child, and, if necessary, also consideration of aspects of the parent's history and personality, and family dynamics."

This diagnosis makes it possible to determine the causes of learning difficulties, whether they are learning disabilities or other difficulties, to describe the conditions under which the child learns optimally, and to provide targeted recommendations for assistance at school, in learning styles, and in assessment methods (including adjustments).",
